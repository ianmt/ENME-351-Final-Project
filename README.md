# ENME-351-Final-Project
M&amp;M Dispenser

The project is an M&M dispenser that uses either a processing game or mean RGB values from a webcam as input. Hopefully I can remember to upload pictures of the project as well as dimensions for each part and the circuit diagrams. A manual switch controls which input is used, however, the user must still run the python/processing scripts manually when switching. Perhaps I will fix this in the future.
