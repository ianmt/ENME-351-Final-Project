# ENME-351-Final-Project
M&amp;M Dispenser

The goal of the project was to use arduino to sense something from the environment, interpret the results with processing, and then actuate something as a result. The project chosen was an M&M dispenser that uses either a processing game or mean RGB values from a webcam as input. A manual switch controls which input is used, however, the user must still run the python/processing scripts manually when switching. Perhaps I will fix this in the future.
